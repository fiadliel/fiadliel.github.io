Welcome to lyranthe.org.

First, a comment about the origin of the word "lyranthe". It's an instrument from the fictional world of
Athera, in the series "The Wars of Light and Shadow", by Janny Wurts. It (and all of Janny's other works)
are wonderful to read, and I highly recommend them! It offers a very thoughtful view on human conflict,
the potential for humans to improve their viewpoint, and human relationships both with each other and
the world.
